# IPlugElementary
An example project to show integration of [Elementary Audio](https://www.elementary.audio) with the [iPlug2](https://iplug2.github.io) framework. Please keep in mind that this is by no means a well-designed plugin. Its purpose is merely to show the integration of Elementary and iPlug.

## Getting started
If you have not yet installed iPlug2, be sure to do so first. Guides for this can be found on the [offical iPlug2 wiki](https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2/wiki).
With iPlug2 installed, all that is left to do is to install the needed `npm` packages for the JS code and run the development server.
Instructions for this can be found in the `README.md` file in the `resources/web` folder.
